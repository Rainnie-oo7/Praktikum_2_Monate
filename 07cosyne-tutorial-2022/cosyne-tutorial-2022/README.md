# Cosyne Tutorial 2022

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/451483302.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/451483302)

These are the exercises for the [COSYNE](https://www.cosyne.org/) 2022 Tutorial, _Spiking Neural Network Models in Neuroscience_, by Dan Goodman.

The exercises are in Python, in the Jupyter Notebook format.
You can run these notebooks either locally, or in the cloud (via Google Colab or Kaggle). 
We recommend following the installation instructions for running locally
(found [below](#run-locally-)) before the conference: the on-site
Wi-Fi might be flaky and not able to handle all participants simultaneously.

Slides are available [here](slides.pdf).



## Run in the cloud ‚òÅ

If you have a Google account, you can launch with Colab.
If you are in a country that blocks Google, such as China, use Kaggle.
(To have the notebook kernel on Kaggle persist more than 15 minutes, register for a Kaggle account).
If you are on mobile and want to just read the notebooks:
Colab offers a better experience than Kaggle or the GitHub notebook renderer.

## Run locally üíª 

Follow the instructions below to install the software that is
necessary to run the exercise notebooks on your own computer.

More detailed instructions are provided further below.

In short, if you already use `conda`:
download this repository, and in this directory, run:
```
conda env create -f environment_brian.yml
conda activate cosyne22_brian
jupyter notebook
```
This is for the first part (which uses [Brian](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/)).

For the second part (which uses PyTorch), you need to create a second environment:
```
conda env create -f environment_torch.yml
conda activate cosyne22_torch
jupyter notebook
```

### Detailed instructions

Click on a section to expand it.

<details>
<summary>1. <b>Install Conda</b></summary>

- If you do not have `conda` already installed, download and run 
  the latest _Miniconda_ installer for your OS over at
  https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#latest-miniconda-installer-links.

- On Windows: in step 5 of the installer ("Advanced Options"),
  tick the checkbox next to "Add Miniconda3 to my PATH environment variable".
  
- On MacOS, Ubuntu, etc, go to 'Terminal' and run `chmod +x` on the downloaded `.sh` file, then run it
  with `./Miniconda3-latest-{os}-{arch}.sh`.
  On Mac, you can also download the `.pkg` file and install that by double-clicking.
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. <b>Download the exercises</b></summary>

- Here on GitHub, at the top of the page, click the green "Code" button, then "Download ZIP".
  Uncompress the downloaded `.zip` to a location of your choosing.

- Alternatively, if you use Git, you can `git clone` this repository
  (or even a new GitHub fork of it, if you think you might contribute in the future).
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. <b>Open a terminal in the exercise directory</b></summary>

- On Windows, either search the Start menu for the built-in 'Command Prompt', 
  or install the more modern [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal#readme)
  from the Microsoft Store ([link](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N0DX20HK701)).
  
- On MacOS or e.g. Ubuntu, run 'Terminal'.

- To run the commands in the following steps, either type or copy-paste them
  into the terminal, and hit `Enter`.

- After starting the terminal, you can use the `cd` command to point it
  to the exercise directory. For example, if you extracted the `.zip` contents
  to `C:\Users\jane\Desktop`, run
  ```
  cd C:\Users\jane\Desktop\cosyne-tutorial-2022-main\
  ```
  (If you `git clone`d the repository, the directory is just called
  `cosyne-tutorial-2022`, without the branch name `-main`).
  
- Alternatively, you can directly open a terminal in the right directory
  using your OS's file explorer (Explorer on Windows, GNOME on Ubuntu, ‚Ä¶),
  by right clicking in the directory.
  - If you've installed Windows Terminal or are e.g. on Ubuntu,
    simply select "Open in (Windows) Terminal" from the right-click menu.
  - This is not applicable to vanilla Windows. (You could hold `Shift`
    while right clicking, and then select "Open PowerShell window here",
    but the `jupyter notebook` command below does not work
    by default in PowerShell).
  
- Your final directory should be the one where this `README.md` 
  and the `environment_{brian|torch}.yml` files are located.
  Use `ls` (or `dir` in Windows' Command Prompt) 
  to see a list of the files in the current directory.
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. <b>Install dependencies</b></summary>

- With your Terminal pointing to the exercise directory, run the following command:
  ```
  conda env create -f environment_brian.yml
  ```
  This will download and install all dependencies.
  It will take a while.
  
- If any errors pop up, retry the command with elevated privileges.
  - On Windows, close the terminal and reopen it with "Run as Administrator".
  - On most other OSes (including MacOS), prepend `sudo` to the command;
    i.e. `sudo conda env create ‚Ä¶`, and enter the password when prompted.

- When the installation was succesful, run
  ```
  conda activate cosyne22_brian
  ```
  This makes sure that all future commands ran in this terminal
  will use the installed software.

</details>

<details>
<summary>5. <b>Run the notebook server</b></summary>

- Still in this terminal in the exercise directory,
  with the `cosyne22_brian` conda environment activated, run
  ```
  jupyter notebook
  ```
  After a short while, this should open your browser,
  showing a list of the files in the current directory. 

- Click on one of the exercise notebook files to open it.
  Try running some of the cells using `Shift`-`Enter`.
  If no errors apear below these cells: congratulations! The installation was succesful.

- Some more information on how to work with a Jupyter Notebook can be found
  e.g. [here](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/#running-cells).

- When you are done with the notebooks, you can exit the notebook server application
  that is still running in your terminal with `Ctrl`-`C`
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. <b>Repeat for Part 2 of the tutorial</b></summary>

- For Part 2, repeat steps 4 & 5,
  but replace `environment_brian.yml` with `environment_torch.yml`,
  and `cosyne22_brian` with `cosyne22_torch`.
  
- The reason we need two separate environments is that PyTorch 
  is difficult to install in the same environment as Brian.
